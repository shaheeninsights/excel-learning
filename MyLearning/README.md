# My Excel learning Log
This folder tracks my daily Excele Learning using Luke Barousse’s YouTube course.

## Day 1 - Setup + Excel basics

- Created this GitHub repo
- Connected my local Excel folder to Git
- Created the MyLearning folder for my own notes
- Used a fictitious dataset provided by the instructor
- Applied formulas with basic maths operators (e.g., +, -, *, /, ^, &).
- Learned the order of mathematical operator execution.
- Used comparison operators (=, >, <, >=, <=, <>).
- Applied cell referencing and autofill.
- Applied percentage format on a column.
- Added needed decimal places as per the requirement.
- Learned fixed and absolute referencing using the $ sign.

## Day 2 – Functions Intro

- Used the same fictitious dataset.
- Explored why functions are used in Excel.
- Calculated averages both manually by cell and using the AVERAGE() function with a cell range.
- Applied the AND() function to evaluate logical conditions.
- Explored the Formula tab, which provides explanations and descriptions of functions.
- Used COUNT() and COUNTIF() functions to count values based on conditions, practicing with static and dynamic criteria.
- Practiced combining static values and cell references using the & operator.
- Used the Mac shortcut Command + T to toggle absolute and relative cell references.

## Errors

Explored common Excel error types and how to handle them: #DIV/0! (e.g., =1/0) division by zero error; #VALUE! (e.g., =B4 + "text") wrong argument type in formula; #REF! (e.g., =#REF!) invalid cell reference, often due to deleted cells; #NAME? (e.g., =COUNTT(A3:A9)) unrecognized function or name; #N/A (e.g., =VLOOKUP("Value", A1:A10, 2, FALSE)) data not available for lookup; #NUM! (e.g., =SQRT(-1)) invalid numeric value in formula; #NULL! (e.g., =SUM(A1:A10 B1:B10)) Incorrect range intersection.
